# kindnessbarter
This project has been created as a part of my final submission to a free Acumen Academy course Human-Centered Design 201: Prototyping.
Kindness Barter doesn't have a back-end to collect and store any input data. In the core it is a random quote generator. (Languages used: HTML, CSS & vanilla Javascript)
