This project has been created as a part of my final submission to a free Acumen Academy course Human-Centered Design 201: Prototyping.(August, 2021)
Kindness Barter doesn't have a back-end to collect and store any input data. In the core it is a random quote generator. 

(Ingredients: HTML, CSS, a ladle of vanilla Javascript and a twig of API)
